# password-manager
This is a command line interface that lets you store an encrypted copy your passwords locally using one master-password. 
Store an encrypted copy of your passwords and decrypt using one master-password.

# Installation
This script runs on `python3`
Clone this repo or download the source code, and navigate to that directory and create folders `pswds` and `cache`. You can now run the `main.py` file from the `terminal` and start using `password-manager`!

### Note
- You will be prompted to give an OTP on your gmail (or any other email) account each time you run the script for security reasons.
- Your master-password is not saved anywhere in any form.
- This is a fun project and the encryption algorithm is designed without using any external encrytion libraries of python and thus may NOT be perfect.
